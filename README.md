My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023

I do this for fun. 

As I have a lot of free time, I take on small challenges, especially on the easier days.

My goal isn't necessarily to do clean code. I aim for solutions that work for both parts with minimal to no modifications.\
On most days, I attempt to do golf code (code with the least number of character as posssible).

## Details
Obviously, I don't modify the input (only remove the empty line at the end if there is one).

Bruteforce forbidden, on multiple days the easiest solution is a rudimentary algorithm that takes a realy long time to end.
As there is always a better solution, I try to do something optimised.

The ouptu must always be (with a single file):
```
part 1: 45664
part 2: 789797
```

### Day 1 to ...
- Golf code, mmust be the shortest possible
- no import, no lambda, no eval
