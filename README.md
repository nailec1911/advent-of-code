My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023

I do this for fun. 

As I have a lot of free time, I take on small challenges, especially on the easier days.

My goal isn't necessarily to do clean code. I aim for solutions that work for both parts with minimal to no modifications.\
On most days, I attempt to do golf code (code with the least number of character as posssible).

## Details
Obviously, I don't modify the input (only remove the empty line at the end if there is one).

Bruteforce forbidden, on multiple days the easiest solution is a rudimentary algorithm that takes a realy long time to end.
As there is always a better solution, I try to do something optimised.

The ouptut must always be (with a single file):
```
part 1: 45664
part 2: 789797
```

### Day 1 to 15
- Golf code, must be the shortest possible, always less than 500 characters (except for day 10)
- no import, no eval
- keep it optimised : I always do a first version which is optimised (see in files history). When I make it shorter I try to keep the optimisation a much as possible.

From day 8 or 9 the problems start to be much more challenging, I don't much time to work on it so the objective of the short solution was only to be less than 500 characters.

### Day 16 to 21
It start to be much more challenging, I didn't manage to do day 17.
I tried the first part of day 22, it work for the example but not for my input (and it is much more than a by-one error). I think I could do it, but I have other things to do (like my internship report, not finished, which I must submit on December 31).

In the next days I won't have time to code, so this is probably the end of the AOC 2023 for me. I think that 20 completed (part 1 and 2) is pretty good and I am really happy to see that I was often in the 5000 first to finish. A good performance as this is the first time I do it seriously, but I am quite sad to stop that close to the 50 stars.

On the day 16-17 weekend I had no access to computer, so I did them 2 days after (didn't manage to do day 17).
Keep in mind that this start at 6a.m for me and I have to go to work at 7:30, so some times I couldn't do it at the start (and I overslept a couple days).
From day 18 to the end I started to code at 9a.m, so 3 hours afer the start.
