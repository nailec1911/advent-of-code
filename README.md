# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, youâ€™ll find my solutions and attempts at the **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)** challenges from various years.

## What is Advent of Code?  

Advent of Code is an annual coding event where, every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming puzzle is released. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice problem-solving and improve coding skills in a festive spirit!

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized by year:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2023/
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Each year's folder contains my solutions for that year's challenges and the informations on how I did it and the general context.
In 2023 I did golf code, it's pretty fun go check it.
In 2024 my objective was to do the 25 days, get a good score, and have a clean code.

## Notes

These are my personal attempts, so they might not always be the most optimal or polished solutions, I don't always have the time to do greate things
