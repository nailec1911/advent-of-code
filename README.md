My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023

I do this for fun. 

As I have a lot of free time, I take on small challenges, especially on the easier days.

My goal isn't necessarily to do clean code. I aim for solutions that work for both parts with minimal to no modifications.\
On most days, I attempt to do golf code (code with the least number of character as posssible).

## Details
Obviously, I don't modify the input (only remove the empty line at the end if there is one).

Bruteforce forbidden, on multiple days the easiest solution is a rudimentary algorithm that takes a realy long time to end.
As there is always a better solution, I try to do something optimised.

The ouptut must always be (with a single file):
```
part 1: 45664
part 2: 789797
```

### Day 1 to ...
- Golf code, must be the shortest possible, always less than 500 characters (except for day 10)
- no import, no eval
- keep it optimised : I always do a first version which is optimised (see in files history), when I make it shorter, I try to keep the optimisation a much as possible.
- 
From day 8 or 9 the problems start to be much more challenging, I don't have all my day to work on it so the objective of the short solution was only to be less than 500 characters. Once this objective was reached, I don't try to improve it anymore.

```
Keep in mind that this start at 6a.m for me and I have to go to work at 7:30, so some times I couldn't do it at the start (and I overslept a couple days)
