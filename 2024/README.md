# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024

This year I'm in my third year at Epitech (IT school). At the beginig I thought I could not do the 25 days (because I have projects to do for my school),
but I managed to do the 25 days.

This year, I wanted to solve all 25 days of coding puzzles while balancing my third year at Epitech (an IT school in France). Initially, I wasn't sure if I could complete all the challenges due to a lack of time, but Iâ€™m thrilled to have successfully completed all 25 days!

## Details

My objective was to achieve a good score. Hence my choice of python, a language I know well (like C or Cpp), that allows me to go fast (not like C), and where I wanted to improve my skills. \
This involved a daily commitment to wake up at 6 AM (France time, it was the harest part), to tackle the challenges right when they were released, all starting my regular schoolwork.

To streamline the process and save time, I created a custom script that:
- Automatically downloads the input for the day.
- Sets up a base file for the challenge.

## Results

Iâ€™m proud of what I accomplished this year!

- Dedication: I woke up at 6 AM every day to solve the puzzles as soon as they were released, aiming for a good score.
- Rankings: On Part 2, my average rank was 3814 (and the best one at 588 !!!), which Iâ€™m very satisfied with given the competition and my busy schedule.
- Code Quality: When I had extra time, I revisited my solutions to:
  - Refine algorithms to avoid brute force approaches and ensure faster solutions.
  - Improve readability and maintainability, making the code clean (and "cool" on some parts).

Feel free to explore my solutions and reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss or improve any of them. Happy coding!


PS: It was really hard to wake up at 6am every day, and even worse on the 23-24-25, when I was with all my familly for christmas.
