My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024

This year I'm in my third year at Epitech (IT school). As we have project to do not have all the time I want.

## Details

This year I am going to try to have a good score. \
Keep in mind that I am in France, meaning that I have to wake up at 6am every day, do the challenge of the day as fast as possible, and then go to my normal day. \
To gain a little time I am going to do a script that downloads the input and create a base file for the day to start working efficiently.
